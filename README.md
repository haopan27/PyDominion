# PyDominion
A Python implementation of the board game Dominion by Donald X. Vaccarino


I got to know Dominion via my roommate while studying in UM, and was instantly hooked to it, especially the card "Militia". I eventually bought the expansion "Intrigue". Unfortunately the physical set of the game was left behind when I moved out of Michigan. But I've always cherished the moments I had with my friends while playing Dominion. Just recently I figured that I could digitalize and perhaps "immortalize" the game by implementing it in Python. And here we have this repository.

As of right now, I assume that the game is played between a human and a computer player which does basic things (e.g., buying Silver into buying Gold and as many Provinces as possible). Only a few cards from the basic set exist, but I plan to add more as time goes by. The game interacts with human player by printing stuff in terminal. PyGame can be a good option to improve the UI.
